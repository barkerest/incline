// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// This manifest inherits the default functionality from the Incline gem.
//
//= require incline/application

// Require any addition scripts you want/need, but you probably do not want to use "require_tree ." since that may
// lead to over-bloated JS code.
